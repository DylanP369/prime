    <p><center> About this Site
    <p>This site was created in August 2019, using HTML by AP Computer Science student Dylan Pastorin. He continues to maintain the site, for as long as he can and as long as he can remember to update, with recent updates in life and new favorites.

    <p>Does anyone remember when this site was filled with memes and the Bee Movie script, mostly to clipfarm whenever Mr. Dunlea would open my site and click a random video and hear a distorted version of the Mario 64 theme? Pepperidge Farm remembers...</p>
    <br>
    <p>Maintaining a website project just to prove I can still somewhat code (despite not being interested in computer science anymore) doesn't mean I peaked in high school... right?</p>
